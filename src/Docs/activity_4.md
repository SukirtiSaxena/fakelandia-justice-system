Activity 4 - Extensions & Deployment
There are many, many improvements we could make - even to a small app like this.

Here are some ideas for extensions - feel free to implement your own ideas too!

ðŸ‘‰ You may have noticed the 1.5s wait when you call generateMisdemeanours. If not, try increasing the sleep(1500) in generateMisdemeanours until it becomes annoying when you reload. Can you show a nice "loading" message while the fake API is loading?

(Hint: One way to do this could be to add an isLoading boolean to state, and using this to conditionally display a loading icon, for example.)

ðŸ‘‰ The home page could be more exciting. Maybe you could add some statistics, like "total misdemeanours" or "number of confessions today"?

ðŸ‘‰ The Confessions page allows users to add details of their confessions, but that data isn't currently being used anywhere. Maybe you could show it on the misdemeanours page?

ðŸ‘‰ How about showing self-confessed misdemeanours in a different colour on the misdemeanours page?

Deployment
It would be really cool to see the full site live on the internet. Github offer free hosting for simple sites like this via a service called Github Pages.

There's an npm package called gh-pages which makes this super simple:

ðŸ‘‰ npm install gh-pages --save-dev

ðŸ‘‰ Add a homepage property at the top of your package.json, so it looks like this:

{
  "name": "your-react-app-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}"
  // where {username} is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of your GitHub repository for this app
    // ... rest of package.json follows here...
ðŸ‘‰ Alter the scripts in package.json by adding a predeploy step and changing the deploy step to push your project to github pages

// ... package.json scripts section...
"scripts": {
  //...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
ðŸ‘‰ npm run deploy should now push your app live to GitHub Pages! Check your repository settings for the URL.

Hooray!
You've done it! You've modernised the extremely unusual justice system of Fakelandia, and hopefully had some fun and got to experiment a little in the process.

Have a well-deserved rest and look forward to using all these skills to make some extremely cool apps!
