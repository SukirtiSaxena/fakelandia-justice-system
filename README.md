## Justice for Fakelandia
# Introduction
The faraway country of Fakelandia has decided to modernise their justice system with a fancy new technology: "websites".

Fakelandia is a happy place with a low crime rate, but it's important to each citizen that justice is seen to be served, so they'd like a website to keep abreast of the latest justice developments

## Crimes and Misdemeanours
The Fakelandians wanted a site that lets them browse lists of crimes committed today, and also for functionality that helps citizens confess to their own crimes.

As a non-citizen, you might not be aware that there are only four possible crimes in Fakelandia:

Mild Public Rudeness

Speaking in a Lift

Not Eating Your Vegetables

Supporting Manchester United

Despite the clear severity of some of these awful crimes, the Fakelandians refer to them all as "misdemeanours".
